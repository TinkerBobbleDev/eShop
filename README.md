# eShop
Angular 10, node express Ecommerce Application with NGRX state management

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
https://github.com/raymond-frontend/eShop.git
cd eShop
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
ng serve
```

The `ng serve` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### ng scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `ng serve` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `ng build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.

These are the test-related scripts:

* `ng test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
* `ng e2e` - run end to end test
